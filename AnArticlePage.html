          <h2>The benefits of Client-side and server-side scripting</h2>
          <p>
          Both of them are useful in their own way.<br><br> Client-side scripting is allowed  multiple interactive interfaces from the user.
          It doesn't require connection to the server. It can be more browser supportive. It can give more freehand or control for web widgets.
          <br><br>
          Server-side scripts users can create a template to the whole website.
          It is loading more faster than client-side scripting.
          Not required to download plugins such as Java, Flash.
          More safety so users only can inspect the HTML scripts.
